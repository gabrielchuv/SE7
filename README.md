# **dontwastefood.no**

This website is a tool for tracking and reducing household food waste. The website notifies/alerts (via selected medium ... email, website alerts, social alerts) when food is about to expire. The site acts as a hub page to track all food items you currently have, visualised by a fun, interactive fridge, you'll gain points for foods you use before the expiry timer hits **0**, if your dumb enough to let it hit 0 you'll be docked points and food waste santa will add you to the naughty list.

## **The Process**

### **Ideation & Concept Development**
**Problem statement:** Given the unsustainable amount of food waste, how might we help UK students and young professions (18-30s) be active in limiting their own food waste.
1. Diverging ideas meeting, brainstorming several ideas each and then building up on each idea as a group
2. Converging ideas meeting, narrows ideas down to top ~4 by voting
3. Miro meeting 1 - double diamond meeting, another diverging meeting going over ideas for the chosen idea of food waste tracking
4. Miro meeting 2 - brainstormed features, prioritised them and narrow them down
5. Miro meeting 3 - started balsmiq wireframing, started to create user persona, thought about user flow and what actions they can take on each page (UX)
6. Finish off balsmiq wireframing/prototyping
7. **next step** show prototype to users
8. Iterate on design based off user feedback

### 1. **System Design**
* Product requirements
* User requirements for key subsystems
* Architecture of the entire systems

### 2. **System Implementation**
* Stack architecture
* Back End - MongoDB - database implementation
* Middle Tier - Express, Node, the RESTful API
* Front End - Angular. Details of implementation
* Deployment details (implementation of Docker)

### 3. **UX Design**
* Design Process, Early prototyping and ideation
* Identification of interacting users and broader stakeholders
* UX approach â€“ design heuristics/approach and methods
* Understanding of user group 
* The evolution of UI wireframes for key subsystems

### 4. **Sprints & Project Management**
* The team's working methods
* Summary of individual contributions
* Documentation of your sprints (high level overview, timeline, and highlights)
* The team's workflow

### 5. **Project Evaluation**
* Reflective discussion of the success of the project
* Discussion of future work
* Reflection on working practices of our team
* Social and ethical implications of our work
