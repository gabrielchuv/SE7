## Design Process
Brief introduction to how we approached this process.

### Ideation & Concept Development
**Problem statement:** Given the unsustainable amount of food waste, how might we help UK students and young professions (18-30s) be active in limiting their own food waste.
1. Diverging ideas meeting, brainstorming several ideas each and then building up on each idea as a group
2. Converging ideas meeting, narrows ideas down to top ~4 by voting
3. Miro meeting 1 - double diamond meeting, another diverging meeting going over ideas for the chosen idea of food waste tracking
4. Miro meeting 2 - brainstormed features, prioritised them and narrow them down
5. Miro meeting 3 - started balsmiq wireframing, started to create user persona, thought about user flow and what actions they can take on each page (UX)
6. Finish off balsmiq wireframing/prototyping
7. **next step** show prototype to users
8. Iterate on design based off user feedback

### Early Prototyping
Could include the powerpoint prototype

## The User

### Identification of Interacting Users

### Understanding of User Group
 questionnaires / user stories / interviews
 
 * Iteration of user persona and evidence of data that backed up iterations

### The Stakeholders

## UX Approach
We implemented several elements from 3 UX approaches: design thinking, lean UX, and systems thinking
We took a pragmatic approach to implementing the user experience using elements from systems thinking, design thinking, and lean UX as necessary.
In this section we outline the rationale behind the choice of these paradigms and the elements that we borrowed from them. The actual implementation
is covered in the next section { link to section }.

* Systems thinking: given the broader socio-environmental issue that we are trying to tackle, we used systems thinking to narrow down the scope
  of our project and maximize our opportunity for impact. The implementation details are outlined in the Problem Scope section { link to section }

* Design thinking: this paradigm allowed us to put the user at the centre of every decision we made. The elements that we implemented were:
  * Problem definition: 
  * User definition:
  * Ideation:
  * Wireframing:
  * Testing:

* Lean UX: we emphasized this approach to tighten our design feedback loop and move closer to a usable and valuable application faster
  * Assumptions:{outline initial assumptions (users, features, problem etc.) }
  * MVP


## Our design timeline: an iterative approach

* Stage 1
  * Initial problem definition
  * Initial user persona
  * Double diamond sessions where we engaged in divergent and convergent thinking
  


* Design iteration
  * 1st - from user stories - done
  * 2nd - from usability test
  * 3rd - from design heuristics and UX principles


To do:
* Usability testing - iterate on assumptions
* User persona survey - iterate on assumptions
* Prioritize MVP features
* Launch MVP, drive traffic to it and gather feedback qualitative/quantitative
