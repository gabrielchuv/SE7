## UX Approach
We took a pragmatic approach to implementing the user experience by using elements from systems thinking, design thinking, and lean UX as necessary.
In this section we outline the rationale behind the choice of these paradigms and the elements that we borrowed from them. The actual implementation
is covered in the following sections.

* Systems thinking: given the broader socio-environmental issue that we are trying to tackle, we used systems thinking to narrow down the scope
  of our project and maximize our opportunity for impact. The implementation details are outlined in the Problem Scope section { link to section }

* Design thinking: this paradigm allowed us to put the user at the centre of every decision we made. The elements that we implemented were:
  * Problem definition: 
  * User definition:
  * Ideation:
  * Wireframing:
  * Testing:

* Lean UX: we emphasized this approach to tighten our design feedback loop and move closer to a usable and valuable application faster
  * Assumptions:{outline initial assumptions (users, features, problem etc.) }
  * MVP

A word about user evaluation: user acceptance testing /evaluation of designs. Details will be provided in next sections 

## Design Timeline

* This section will outline and focus on the iterative nature of our design development. Initial versions of user personas, wireframes etc. and how they
  evolved as we gathered more data and feedback. I would suggest doing it in chronological order.
  
* Ideation
  * All the divergent/convergent activities (outlined below)
  * Problem definition
  * Initial user persona
  * Prioritization of features
  * User flow creation
* Wireframing / early prototyping
  * Balsamiq wireframing according to user stories
  * Got feedback for first wireframe
    * Changed our problem assumption accordingly and modified wireframe
  * Got feedback from surveys
    * Changed our target audience assumption accordingly
  * -- NOT DONE YET -- Got feedback for second wireframe
  * -- NOT DONE YET -- Design heuristics and UX principles session
  * -- NOT DONE YET -- Prioritization of features for MVP
  * -- NOT DONE YET -- (Maybe) - ful interaction flow diagram for prioritized features
  * -- NOT DONE YET -- Drive traffic and gather qualitative/quantitative feedback
  * -- NOT DONE YET -- Think of design/product future work

To do:
* Process survey data and re-define user persona
* Target this persona in next user feedbac cycle

## Design Process 
### Ideation & Concept Development
Design sessions were conducted to define the problem, develop the project idea and create wireframes to test with users. 

Session 1: diverging ideas: each member brainstormed several ideas and those ideas were developed further as a group. 

Session 2: converging ideas: the team voted on the top 4 ideas.

Session 3: design thinking: the team was led through a formal double-diamond design thinking session, divering and convering on various project ideas. The idea of a food waste tracker was chosen.

Session 4: brainstorming features: the team brainstormed features and prioritized them into three categories: core features, useful features, nice to have.

Session 5: user persona and wireframing: The target user and the user flow were defined. An outline of the wireframe was created with each page having a specific task.

Session 6: wireframing: the initial wireframe was completed.

Session 7: the wireframe was tested with users. 

Session 8: evaluating feedback: key issues from the walk-through were discussed. The project idea shifted to a food waste calculated. A new wireframe was created. 

### First Prototype: Reminder for Expiring Foods
TODO

### User Feedback: Wireframe Walk-through
The wireframe for an application to remind users of expiring foods was evaluated with 5 users aged 18-30 who were interested in sustainability. During a virtual walk-through, users were asked to navigate each page to accomplish tasks including registering for an account, searching for items, editing expiration dates and setting notification preferences. Any difficulties were noted. 

The session highlighted key issues in usability and informed the next iteration of the prototype. The issues were as follows: 
1. **The platform as a web application did not align with user's routine of grocery shopping.** The prototype assumed users could input all grocery items and expirations dates after grocery shopping and check the platform for expiring foods. However, a user noted that he would prefer a mobile or smart fridge application than a web application for such tasks as that can be easily done while he is "on the go" or by the fridge. 
2. **The burden of inputting and editing food items was greater than the benefit of reminders.** Users agreed that the process of inputting and editing items involved “too many clicks.” One user commented, “It’s going to be faster to go to my fridge and check expiration dates instead of going to my laptop and inputting all of the foods.” 
3. **The application promoted awareness but was not actionable to change behavior.** A user admitted that reminders of expiring food is good to know but would not incentivise him to reduce food waste. Information regarding money lost would: “If it tells me, 'You wasted $25 bucks,' I’m like 'ugh' I wasted $25. The next time I go grocery shopping, instead of getting a gallon of milk, I’ll get half that and adjust my grocery buying. After months or weeks hopefully I'm closer to 0 wastage.” He suggested providing a metric of food wasted and tackling the causes themselves including poor planning and over-buying. 

### Second Prototype: Food Waste Calculator
User feedback informed the second prototype which calculates cost accrued for food wasted per individual. To address issues (1) and (2), users will only have to input food wasted, which is not dependent on when they shop for groceries. Less information is required from users to produce the output: a calculation of money lost and environmental damage done by food wasted. To address (3), users are informed of the amount of food wasted in pounds along with a personalized goal (e.g, buy fewer groceries). Social norming and a personalized goal could nudge behavior change.
