### **Ideation & Concept Development**
**Problem statement:** Given the unsustainable amount of food waste, how might we help UK students and young professions (18-30s) be active in limiting their own food waste.
1. Diverging ideas meeting, brainstorming several ideas each and then building up on each idea as a group
2. Converging ideas meeting, narrows ideas down to top ~4 by voting
3. Miro meeting 1 - double diamond meeting, another diverging meeting going over ideas for the chosen idea of food waste tracking
4. Miro meeting 2 - brainstormed features, prioritised them and narrow them down
5. Miro meeting 3 - started balsmiq wireframing, started to create user persona, thought about user flow and what actions they can take on each page (UX)
6. Finish off balsmiq wireframing/prototyping
7. **next step** show prototype to users
8. Iterate on design based off user feedback
