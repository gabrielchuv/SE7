## Design Process
Brief introduction to how we approached this process.

### Ideation & Concept Development
**Problem statement:** Given the unsustainable amount of food waste, how might we help UK students and young professions (18-30s) be active in limiting their own food waste.
1. Diverging ideas meeting, brainstorming several ideas each and then building up on each idea as a group
2. Converging ideas meeting, narrows ideas down to top ~4 by voting
3. Miro meeting 1 - double diamond meeting, another diverging meeting going over ideas for the chosen idea of food waste tracking
4. Miro meeting 2 - brainstormed features, prioritised them and narrow them down
5. Miro meeting 3 - started balsmiq wireframing, started to create user persona, thought about user flow and what actions they can take on each page (UX)
6. Finish off balsmiq wireframing/prototyping
7. **next step** show prototype to users
8. Iterate on design based off user feedback

### Early Prototyping
Could include the powerpoint prototype

## The User

### Identification of Interacting Users

### Understanding of User Group
 questionnaires / user stories / interviews
 
 * Iteration of user persona and evidence of data that backed up iterations

### The Stakeholders

## UX Approach
We implemented several elements from 3 UX approaches: design thinking, lean UX, and systems thinking
* Design thinking {explain importance and choice of this paradigm}
  * Defined problem: {problem statement}
  * Ideation: {summary of the ideation and concept development process}
  * Wireframe: {summary of first wireframe's process (developed it from user stories) and link to full}
  * Testing: {key takeaways from intial usability interviews and link to modified wireframe}
* Lean UX {explain importance and choice of this paradigm}
  * Assumptions: {outline initial assumptions (users, features, problem etc.) }
  * Design: what was done above
  * MVP: need to define MVP by prioritizing features
* Systems thinking {explain importance and choice of this paradigm}


## The Evolution of UI Wireframes and design heuristics

* Design iteration
  * 1st - from user stories - done
  * 2nd - from usability test
  * 3rd - from design heuristics and UX principles


To do:
* Usability testing - iterate on assumptions
* User persona survey - iterate on assumptions
* Prioritize MVP features
* Launch MVP, drive traffic to it and gather feedback qualitative/quantitative
