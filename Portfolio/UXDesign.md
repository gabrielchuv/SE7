## UX Approach
We took a pragmatic approach to implementing the user experience by using elements from systems thinking, design thinking, and lean UX as necessary.
In this section we outline the rationale behind the choice of these paradigms and the elements that we borrowed from them. The actual implementation
is covered in the following sections.

* Systems thinking: given the broader socio-environmental issue that we are trying to tackle, we used systems thinking to narrow down the scope
  of our project and maximize our opportunity for impact. The implementation details are outlined in the Problem Scope section { link to section }

* Design thinking: this paradigm allowed us to put the user at the centre of every decision we made. The elements that we implemented were:
  * Problem definition: 
  * User definition:
  * Ideation:
  * Wireframing:
  * Testing:

* Lean UX: we emphasized this approach to tighten our design feedback loop and move closer to a usable and valuable application faster
  * Assumptions:{outline initial assumptions (users, features, problem etc.) }
  * MVP

A word about user evaluation: user acceptance testing /evaluation of designs. Details will be provided in next sections 

## Last versions of stuff

### User

#### User Persona
#### User stories

### Wireframe/mockup


## Design Timeline

* This section will outline and focus on the iterative nature of our design development. Initial versions of user personas, wireframes etc. and how they
  evolved as we gathered more data and feedback. I would suggest doing it in chronological order.
  
* Ideation
  * All the divergent/convergent activities (outlined below)
  * Problem definition
  * Initial user persona
  * Prioritization of features
  * User flow creation
* Wireframing / early prototyping
  * Balsamiq wireframing according to user stories
  * Got feedback for first wireframe
    * Changed our problem assumption accordingly and modified wireframe
  * Got feedback from surveys
    * Changed our target audience assumption accordingly
  * -- NOT DONE YET -- Got feedback for second wireframe
  * -- NOT DONE YET -- Design heuristics and UX principles session
  * -- NOT DONE YET -- Prioritization of features for MVP
  * -- NOT DONE YET -- (Maybe) - ful interaction flow diagram for prioritized features
  * -- NOT DONE YET -- Drive traffic and gather qualitative/quantitative feedback
  * -- NOT DONE YET -- Think of design/product future work

To do:
* Process survey data and re-define user persona
* Target this persona in next user feedbac cycle

### Ideation & Concept Development
**Problem statement:** Given the unsustainable amount of food waste, how might we help UK students and young professions (18-30s) be active in limiting their own food waste.
1. Diverging ideas meeting, brainstorming several ideas each and then building up on each idea as a group
2. Converging ideas meeting, narrows ideas down to top ~4 by voting
3. Miro meeting 1 - double diamond meeting, another diverging meeting going over ideas for the chosen idea of food waste tracking
4. Miro meeting 2 - brainstormed features, prioritised them and narrow them down
5. Miro meeting 3 - started balsmiq wireframing, started to create user persona, thought about user flow and what actions they can take on each page (UX)
6. Finish off balsmiq wireframing/prototyping
7. **next step** show prototype to users
8. Iterate on design based off user feedback

### Early Prototyping
Could include the powerpoint prototype

## The User

### Identification of Interacting Users

### Understanding of User Group
 questionnaires / user stories / interviews
 
 * Iteration of user persona and evidence of data that backed up iterations

### The Stakeholders
