## The Team's Working Methods
Group working methods used (for instance did your team choose a particular style of agile? what communication channels did you use?)
Projects on github used for tracking database progress and changes so it is possible to see which stage we are on

## Summary of Individual Contributions
Discussion of team roles (specialisation is ok!). A summary of individual contributions

## Documentation of Sprints
Documentation of your sprints, including both high level overview, timeline, and selected highlights that were critical points in the project (remember to show the users stories implemented in each sprint). We expect a summary of meeting logs (including for instance apologies for absence etc)

## The team's workflow
Team use of Git, how your team used continuous integration / continuous deployment. Streamlining of workflow throughout.
